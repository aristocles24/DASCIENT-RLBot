# DASCIENT-RLBot
This Python program uses reinforcement learning (RL) to build a trading bot that can make decisions based on live stock market data. The bot fetches real-time market data using Yahoo Finance, analyzes it, and makes decisions (buy, sell, or hold) using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** model.
